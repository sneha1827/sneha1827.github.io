                <h2> HTML </h2>
                <P>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. "Markup language" 
                    means that, rather than using a programming language to 
                    perform functions, HTML uses tags to identify different 
                    types of content and the purposes they each serve to the 
                    webpage.

                <h2> CSS </h2>
                <P>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
                     This programming language dictates how the HTML 
                     elements of a website should actually appear on the
                      frontend of the page.CSS is used to design the webpage 
                      for better layouts for the user, that the user can feel
                       comfortable with the Web page.

                <h2> JAVASCRIPT </h2>
                <P>It is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted 
                    scripting language. It is well-known for the development 
                    of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. 
                    JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as 
                    well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a 
                    standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, 
                    and a core set of language elements like operators, 
                    control structures, and statements. JavaScript can be 
                    used as Client-Side as well as Server-Side.
